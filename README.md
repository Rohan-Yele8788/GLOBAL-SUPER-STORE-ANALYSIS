# 1.  Overall Sales and Profit:

Sales in 2012 show higher values compared to 2013,2014,2015 especially during the last quarter. Total Sale Category indicates the Technology was Growth in Trends. This indicates a possible seasonal peak in sales during the year-end, which could be driven by holiday shopping.

# 3. High Return Rate:

# 4. Sales by Segments:
The Consumer segment leads with 48% of total sales. However, the Corporate and Home Office segments combined account for over 50%, indicating potential for increased targeting or marketing towards these business customers for further growth.

# 5. Regional Sales Distribution:

Office Supplies is the top-performing category with $37,87,492.51M in sales, followed by Technology ($47,44,557.50M) and Furniture ($41,10,451.90M). This indicates that Office Supplies is driving the bulk of sales, but there’s growth potential in Technology and Furniture categories.

Consumer is the most preferred shipping mode with $26518M in sales, Corporate is the most preferred shipping mode with $15429M in sales, Home Office is the most preferred shipping mode with $9343M in sales ,likely because it is more cost-effective. Same Day shipping has minimal sales, indicating that either customers are less interested in fast shipping or that it's not being marketed effectively.

# 8. Sub-Category Focus:
Phones is the highest-selling sub-category with $1.7M, followed by Copiers ($1.5M) and Chairs ($1.501M) and Bookcases ($1.4M). These sub-categories represent key drivers of revenue and should be prioritized for inventory and marketing efforts.

The average Delivary Days  is 3  days, which seems reasonable, but there may be room for improvement to boost customer satisfaction, especially with rising competition offering faster shipping options.
